## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Setup Instructions
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd weather-dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Get your API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:
   ```
   VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```
   npx vite
   ```

6. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173`

## Customization Options
- **Default Location**: Set your preferred default city in the settings
- **Temperature Units**: Switch between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin
- **Theme**: Toggle between light and dark modes
- **Notifications**: Enable or disable weather alerts

## Components Breakdown
- **CurrentWeather.vue**: Displays current weather conditions
- **ForecastChart.vue**: Interactive chart for weather forecast
- **WeatherAlert.vue**: Displays weather alerts and warnings
- **FavoriteLocations.vue**: Manage favorite locations
- **SettingsPanel.vue**: User preferences and settings

## State Management
The application uses Pinia for state management, which handles:
- Current weather data

- Weather alerts
- Favorite locations
- Loading states
- Error messages

## API Integration
The application integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API through a dedicated service layer that handles:
- Current weather data retrieval

## Responsive Design
The application is fully responsive with three breakpoints:
- Mobile (320px - 767px): Single column layout
- Tablet (768px - 1023px): Two-column layout
- Desktop (1024px+): Three-column layout

## Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of components
- Efficient state management with Pinia
- Optimized API calls
- Minimal bundle size
- Caching of favorites and settings in localStorage

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy to Production**: Build and deploy the application to a hosting service
2. **Add Geolocation**: Implement automatic location detection
3. **Enhance Accessibility**: Improve WCAG compliance
4. **Add Internationalization**: Support multiple languages
5. **Implement Push Notifications**: Browser notifications for severe weather

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
1. Ensure your API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
2. Verify you have Node.js version 14 or higher installed
